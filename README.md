# Salve Yourself: Hippo Crowdfunding Campaign
Description/Introduction: Salve is an affordable, all natural, homeopathic approach to chapped lips, wounds, and even sore muscles. Simple herbs and plants found anywhere in nature will work wonders on your body. With the help of beeswax and our method, you can make salve in your own home and package in your own favorite container. We've been making and using Salve Yourself for over 12 years and swear by this stuff. But don't take our word, try it today!

What we need to prepare beforehand:
   1. Emails-at different stages. First, email to introduce the product and invite them to donate. Second: "Thank you" to the donors with "deliverables*." Third, updates on the production status to our "bosses." 2b, Possibly send out a "Don't miss out" clip or video to those who chose NOT to donate in the first round. Finally, a "Launch" video with credits to bosses.
   2. A list of what we need to make the salve, so that we can prepare to make it.
   3. Write instructions on how to make it. E-manual.
   4. Record a video about how to make the salve.
   5. Hand written thank you notes ready to sign, address, and mail to people.
